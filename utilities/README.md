# Utilities

Standalone inspection and reporting tools for patches and mesh debugging. Example usage:

- python utilities/inspect_patch0_nodes.py
- python utilities/highlight_patch0.py
- python utilities/check_patch_centering.py
- python utilities/list_patches_verbose.py
- python utilities/patch_visual_labels.py
- python utilities/patch_boundary_report.py
- python utilities/patch_fill_check.py
- python utilities/inspect_boundary_debug.py
- python utilities/inspect_one_patch.py
- python utilities/debug_patch_stats.py
- python utilities/patch_log_analyze.py /path/to/patch_log.csv

These tools use the same synthetic mesh builders as the demos and write PNG or CSV outputs in the repo root.
